                            I have a fasination with simple design. A single point source speaker uses<br> a single driver to cover all of the frequencies. The reason that these are<br> interesting is that they need no crossovers which many believe to tarnish the sound.

                    <p>I currently own a Dynco ST-70 tube amplifier. It is incredible sounding and can get<br> louder than my apartment will allow for. I like tube amplifiers because they <br>can reproduce sounds in a very smooth way; whereas they don't color the sounds<br> or make music harsh.</p>

                    <p>I own a 1980 VW Rabbit that I am in the process of rebuilding and restoring. It's a<br> long process but it is entertaining to me. There is a sense of zen I get from <br>slowly piecing something mechanical back together for use.</p>

                    <p>I used to have a more modern Triumph that I managed to put almost 10,000 miles on in<br> about a year and a half. I rode it almost every day. I also really enjoy the<br> old Triumphs from the 60's and 70's. The way they run is something that will<br> never exist again.</p>

                    <p>I would like to one day own a 70's Yamaha XS650. Yamaha basically decided to make a Triumph<br> but one that ran all of the time which Triumphs were not known to do.</p>

                <p>Mika is my first cat; she is about 7 years old. I got her on a whim when a friend asked me if I<br> wanted a kitten. She is definitely a weird cat in that she wants attention<br> but also doesn't to be touched by anyone but me.</p>
                <li>Gilly</li>
                <img src="C:\Users\Nick's Laptop\lc101\html-me-something\images\Gilly.jpg"/>
                <p>Gilly, short for Ms. McGillicuddy, is my nice cat who likes to eat and cuddle. She wants to be anywhere <br>that is warm, or in your way directly. She isn't the brightest but she is very <br>funny and sweet.</p>
